I've never had a strong internet presence, mostly because of the effort didn't feel like it was worth it. Creating a personal website is a lot of effort, social networks are incredibly disatisfying and unoriginal, and being proffesional wasn't a big concern of mine before.

However, today I'm humming a different tune. This is a move in a different direction. Having a professional face on the internet is a necessity and being able to show people what I'm working on at any given moment seemed way more valuable than being a stubborn Luddite that was afraid of the possibility of negative attention.

This site will be my new landing page for everything that I'm doing. Linking to projects and blog entries are the main focus right now, but my other interests and ventures may end up here as well.

Come back for project announcements and more!
