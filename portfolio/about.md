I'm a software engineer in the middle of California on the Central Coast in a little city called San Luis Obispo. I currently work at iFixit full time. I have a few hobbies such as: bouldering, tennis, running, cooking, learning languages, programming, frisby golf, bartending, piano, and many more.
